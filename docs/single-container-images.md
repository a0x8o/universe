In addition to VM images, Netsil AOC also comes packaged as a single container image for staging environments. Please note that the single container instance of Netsil AOC does not support scale-out by adding more worker instances. However, you can allocate more CPU cores and Memory to scale-up Netsil AOC's single container installation.

For all single-container variants of Netsil, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/netsil/manifests) to install and deploy them.
